![Project Banner](images/banner.png)

> **"Because in football, it's the fine margins that decide glory."**  

This project dives deep into the **2024–25 European football season** — engineering features, analyzing performance trends, and building **interactive Tableau dashboards** to visualize the story behind the stats.

---

## 📌 Overview
- **Objective:** Understand how small statistical edges translate into big results for elite football clubs.  
- **Scope:** Data processing in Python + advanced visualizations in Tableau.  
- **Key Tools:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `Tableau`.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Engineering:** Cleaned and transformed match & player data into a structured analytics-ready format.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Identified trends in goals, assists, possession, and shot quality.
- **Custom Metrics:** Built metrics like **Clutch xG** & **Finishing Efficiency**.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Multiple Tableau views for team metrics and featured insights.
- **Exportable Insights:** Ready-to-use CSV outputs for further modeling.
